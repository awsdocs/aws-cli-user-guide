# Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer \(Linux, macOS, or Unix\)<a name="awscli-install-bundle"></a>

On Linux, macOS, or Unix, you can also use the bundled installer to install the AWS CLI\. The bundled installer includes all dependencies and can be used offline\.

**Important**  
The bundled installer does not support installing to paths that contain spaces\.

## Prerequisites<a name="install-bundle-other-os-prereq"></a>

+ Linux, macOS, or Unix

+ Python 2 version 2\.7\+ or Python 3 version 3\.3\+

Check your Python installation:

```
$ python --version
```

If your computer doesn't already have Python installed, or you would like to install a different version of Python, follow the procedure in \.

## Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer<a name="install-bundle-other"></a>

Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI using the bundled installer\.

**To install the AWS CLI using the bundled installer**

1. Download the [AWS CLI Bundled Installer](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip)\.

   ```
   $ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
   ```

1. Unzip the package\.

   ```
   $ unzip awscli-bundle.zip
   ```
**Note**  
If you don't have `unzip`, use your Linux distribution's built in package manager to install it\.

1. Run the install executable\.

   ```
   $ sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
   ```
**Note**  
By default, the install script runs under the system default version of Python\. If you have installed an alternative version of Python and want to use that to install the AWS CLI, run the install script with that version by absolute path to the Python executable\. For example:  

   ```
   $ sudo /usr/local/bin/python2.7 awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
   ```

The installer installs the AWS CLI at `/usr/local/aws` and creates the symlink `aws` at the `/usr/local/bin` directory\. Using the `-b` option to create a symlink eliminates the need to specify the install directory in the user's `$PATH` variable\. This should enable all users to call the AWS CLI by typing `aws` from any directory\.

To see an explanation of the `-i` and `-b` options, use the `-h` option:

```
$ ./awscli-bundle/install -h
```

## Install the AWS CLI Without Sudo \(Linux, macOS, or Unix\)<a name="install-bundle-user"></a>

If you don't have sudo permissions or want to install the AWS CLI only for the current user, you can use a modified version of the above commands:

```
$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
$ unzip awscli-bundle.zip
$ ./awscli-bundle/install -b ~/bin/aws
```

This installs the AWS CLI to the default location \(`~/.local/lib/aws`\) and create a symbolic link \(symlink\) at `~/bin/aws`\. Make sure that `~/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable for the symlink to work:

```
$ echo $PATH | grep ~/bin     // See if $PATH contains ~/bin (output will be empty if it doesn't)
$ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH     // Add ~/bin to $PATH if necessary
```

**Tip**  
To ensure that your $PATH settings are retained between sessions, add the `export` line to your shell profile \(\~/\.profile, \~/\.bash\_profile, etc\)\.

## Uninstalling<a name="install-bundle-uninstall"></a>

The bundled installer does not put anything outside of the installation directory except the optional symlink, so uninstalling is as simple as deleting those two items\.

```
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/aws
$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aws
```
