+ [Troubleshooting AWS CLI install and uninstall errors](#install-tshoot)
+ [Next steps](#install-next-steps)

## AWS CLI installation instructions<a name="getting-started-install-instructions"></a>

**Important**  
AWS CLI versions 1 and 2 use the same `aws` command name\. If you previously installed AWS CLI version 1, see [Migrating from AWS CLI version 1 to version 2](cliv2-migration.md)\.

For installation instructions, expand the section for your operating system\.

### Linux<a name="install-linux"></a>

#### Installation requirements<a name="install-linux-prereqs"></a>
+ You must be able to extract or "unzip" the downloaded package\. If your operating system doesn't have the built\-in `unzip` command, use an equivalent\.
+ The AWS CLI uses `glibc`, `groff`, and `less`\. These are included by default in most major distributions of Linux\.
+ We support the AWS CLI on 64\-bit versions of recent distributions of CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 1, Amazon Linux 2 and Linux ARM\.
+ Because AWS doesn't maintain third\-party repositories, we can’t guarantee that they contain the latest version of the AWS CLI\.

#### Install or update the AWS CLI<a name="install-linux-instructions"></a>

Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI on Linux\.

We provide the steps in one easy to copy and paste group based on whether you use 64\-bit Linux or Linux ARM\. See the descriptions of each line in the steps that follow\.

------
#### [ Linux x86 \(64\-bit\) ]

```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
$ unzip awscliv2.zip
$ sudo bash ./aws/install
$ sudo rm -rf ./aws/
```

------
#### [ Linux ARM ]

```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
$ unzip awscliv2.zip
$ sudo bash ./aws/install
$ sudo rm -rf ./aws/
```

------

1. Download the installation file in one of the following ways:

------
#### [ Linux x86 \(64\-bit\) ]
   + **Use the `curl` command** – The `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to\. The options on the following example command write the downloaded file to the current directory with the local name `awscliv2.zip`\. 

     ```
     $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
     ```
   + **Downloading from the URL** – To download the installer with your browser, use the following URL: [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip)

------
#### [ Linux ARM ]
   + **Use the `curl` command** – The `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to\. The options on the following example command write the downloaded file to the current directory with the local name `awscliv2.zip`\. 

     ```
     $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
     ```
   + **Downloading from the URL** – To download the installer with your browser, use the following URL: [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip)

------

1. **\(Optional\) Verifying the integrity of your downloaded zip file**

   If you chose to manually download the AWS CLI installer package `.zip` in the above steps, you can use the following steps to verify the signatures by using the `GnuPG` tool\.

   The AWS CLI installer package `.zip` files are cryptographically signed using PGP signatures\. If there is any damage or alteration of the files, this verification fails and you should not proceed with installation\.

   1. Download and install the `gpg` command using your package manager\. For more information about `GnuPG`, see the [GnuPG website](https://www.gnupg.org/)\. 

   1. To create the public key file, create a text file and paste in the following text\.

      -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
      ```

      For reference, the following are the details of the public key\.

      ```
      Key ID:           A6310ACC4672
      Type:             RSA
      Size:             4096/4096
      Created:          2019-09-18
      Expires:          2023-09-17
      User ID:          AWS CLI Team <aws-cli@amazon.com>
      Key fingerprint:  FB5D B77F D5C1 18B8 0511  ADA8 A631 0ACC 4672 475C
      ```

   1. Import the AWS CLI public key with the following command, substituting *public\-key\-file\-name* with the file name of the public key you created\.

      ```
      $ gpg --import public-key-file-name
      gpg: /home/username/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
      gpg: key A6310ACC4672475C: public key "AWS CLI Team <aws-cli@amazon.com>" imported
      gpg: Total number processed: 1
      gpg:               imported: 1
      ```

   1. Download the AWS CLI signature file for the package you downloaded\. It has the same path and name as the `.zip` file it corresponds to, but has the extension `.sig`\. In the following examples, we save it to the current directory as a file named `awscliv2.sig`\.

------
#### [ Linux x86 \(64\-bit\) ]

      **For the latest version of the AWS CLI,** use the following command block:

      ```
      $ curl -o awscliv2.sig https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip.sig
      ```

      **For a specific version of the AWS CLI,** append a hyphen and the version number to the filename\. For this example the filename for version *2\.0\.30* would be `awscli-exe-linux-x86_64-2.0.30.zip.sig` resulting in the following command:

      ```
      $ curl -o awscliv2.sig https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64-2.0.30.zip.sig
      ```

       For a list of versions, see the [AWS CLI version 2 Changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/v2/CHANGELOG.rst?plain=1) on *GitHub*\.

------
#### [ Linux ARM ]

      **For the latest version of the AWS CLI, **use the following command block:

      ```
      $ curl -o awscliv2.sig https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip.sig
      ```

      **For a specific version of the AWS CLI, **append a hyphen and the version number to the filename\. For this example the filename for version *2\.0\.30* would be `awscli-exe-linux-aarch64-2.0.30.zip.sig` resulting in the following command:

      ```
      $ curl -o awscliv2.sig https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64-2.0.30.zip.sig
      ```

       For a list of versions, see the [AWS CLI version 2 Changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/v2/CHANGELOG.rst?plain=1) on *GitHub*\.

------

   1. Verify the signature, passing both the downloaded `.sig` and `.zip` file names as parameters to the `gpg` command\.

      ```
      $ gpg --verify awscliv2.sig awscliv2.zip
      ```

      The output should look similar to the following\.

      ```
      gpg: Signature made Mon Nov  4 19:00:01 2019 PST
      gpg:                using RSA key FB5D B77F D5C1 18B8 0511 ADA8 A631 0ACC 4672 475C
      gpg: Good signature from "AWS CLI Team <aws-cli@amazon.com>" [unknown]
      gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
      gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
      Primary key fingerprint: FB5D B77F D5C1 18B8 0511  ADA8 A631 0ACC 4672 475C
      ```
**Important**  
The warning in the output is expected and doesn't indicate a problem\. It occurs because there isn't a chain of trust between your personal PGP key \(if you have one\) and the AWS CLI PGP key\. For more information, see [Web of trust](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust)\.

1. Unzip the installer\. If your Linux distribution doesn't have a built\-in `unzip` command, use an equivalent to unzip it\. The following example command unzips the package and creates a directory named `aws` under the current directory\.

   ```
   $ unzip awscliv2.zip
   ```
**Note**  
When updating from a previous version, the `unzip` command prompts to overwrite existing files\. To skip these prompts, such as with script automation, use the `-u` update flag for `unzip`\. This flag automatically updates existing files and creates new ones as needed\.  

   ```
   $ unzip -u awscliv2.zip
   ```

1. Run the install program\. The installation command uses a file named `install` in the newly unzipped `aws` directory\. By default, the files are all installed to `/usr/local/aws-cli`, and a symbolic link is created in `/usr/local/bin`\. The command includes `sudo` to grant write permissions to those directories\. 

   ```
   $ sudo ./aws/install
   ```

   You can install without `sudo` if you specify directories that you already have write permissions to\. Use the following instructions for the `install` command to specify the installation location:
   + Ensure that the paths you provide to the `-i` and `-b` parameters contain no volume name or directory names that contain any space characters or other white space characters\. If there is a space, the installation fails\.
   + `--install-dir` or `-i` – This option specifies the directory to copy all of the files to\.

     The default value is `/usr/local/aws-cli`\.
   + `--bin-dir` or `-b` – This option specifies that the main `aws` program in the install directory is symbolically linked to the file `aws` in the specified path\. You must have write permissions to the specified directory\. Creating a symlink to a directory that is already in your path eliminates the need to add the install directory to the user's `$PATH` variable\. 

     The default value is `/usr/local/bin`\.

   ```
   $ ./aws/install -i /usr/local/aws-cli -b /usr/local/bin
   ```
**Note**  
To update your current installation of the AWS CLI, add your existing symlink and installer information to construct the `install` command with the `--update` parameter\.  

   ```
   $ sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir /usr/local/bin --install-dir /usr/local/aws-cli --update
   ```
To locate the existing symlink and installation directory, use the following steps:  
Use the `which` command to find your symlink\. This gives you the path to use with the `--bin-dir` parameter\.  

      ```
      $ which aws
      /usr/local/bin/aws
      ```
Use the `ls` command to find the directory that your symlink points to\. This gives you the path to use with the `--install-dir` parameter\.  

      ```
      $ ls -l /usr/local/bin/aws
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 ec2-user ec2-user 49 Oct 22 09:49 /usr/local/bin/aws -> /usr/local/aws-cli/v2/current/bin/aws
      ```

1. Confirm the installation with the following command\. 

   ```
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.7.24 Python/3.8.8 Linux/4.14.133-113.105.amzn2.x86_64 botocore/2.4.5
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting AWS CLI errors](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md)\.

### macOS<a name="install-macos"></a>

#### Installation requirements<a name="install-macos-prereqs"></a>
+ We support the AWS CLI on Apple\-supported versions of 64\-bit macOS\.
+ Because AWS doesn't maintain third\-party repositories, we can’t guarantee that they contain the latest version of the AWS CLI\.

#### Install or update the AWS CLI<a name="install-macos0-instructions"></a>

If you are updating to the latest version, use the same installation method that you used in your current version\. You can install the AWS CLI on macOS in the following ways\.

------
#### [ GUI installer ]

The following steps show how to install the latest version of the AWS CLI by using the standard macOS user interface and your browser\.

1. In your browser, download the macOS `pkg` file: [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg)

1. Run your downloaded file and follow the on\-screen instructions\. You can choose to install the AWS CLI in the following ways:
   + **For all users on the computer \(requires `sudo`\)**
     + You can install to any folder, or choose the recommended default folder of `/usr/local/aws-cli`\.
     + The installer automatically creates a symlink at `/usr/local/bin/aws` that links to the main program in the installation folder you chose\.
   + **For only the current user \(doesn't require `sudo`\)**
     + You can install to any folder to which you have write permission\.
     + Due to standard user permissions, after the installer finishes, you must manually create a symlink file in your `$PATH` that points to the `aws` and `aws_completer` programs by using the following commands at the command prompt\. If your `$PATH` includes a folder you can write to, you can run the following command without `sudo` if you specify that folder as the target's path\. If you don't have a writable folder in your `$PATH`, you must use `sudo` in the commands to get permissions to write to the specified target folder\. The default location for a symlink is `/usr/local/bin/`\.

       ```
       $ sudo ln -s /folder/installed/aws-cli/aws /usr/local/bin/aws
       $ sudo ln -s /folder/installed/aws-cli/aws_completer /usr/local/bin/aws_completer
       ```
**Note**  
You can view debug logs for the installation by pressing **Cmd\+L** anywhere in the installer\. This opens a log pane that enables you to filter and save the log\. The log file is also automatically saved to `/var/log/install.log`\.

1. To verify that the shell can find and run the `aws` command in your `$PATH`, use the following commands\. 

   ```
   $ which aws
   /usr/local/bin/aws 
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.7.24 Python/3.8.8 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.4.5
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting AWS CLI errors](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md)\.

------
#### [ Command line installer \- All users ]

If you have `sudo` permissions, you can install the AWS CLI for all users on the computer\. We provide the steps in one easy to copy and paste group\. See the descriptions of each line in the following steps\. 

```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
$ sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

1. Download the file using the `curl` command\. The `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to\. In this example, the file is written to `AWSCLIV2.pkg` in the current folder\.

   ```
   $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
   ```

1. Run the standard macOS `installer` program, specifying the downloaded `.pkg` file as the source\. Use the `-pkg` parameter to specify the name of the package to install, and the `-target /` parameter for which drive to install the package to\. The files are installed to `/usr/local/aws-cli`, and a symlink is automatically created in `/usr/local/bin`\. You must include `sudo` on the command to grant write permissions to those folders\. 

   ```
   $ sudo installer -pkg ./AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
   ```

   After installation is complete, debug logs are written to `/var/log/install.log`\.

1. To verify that the shell can find and run the `aws` command in your `$PATH`, use the following commands\. 

   ```
   $ which aws
   /usr/local/bin/aws 
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.7.24 Python/3.8.8 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.4.5
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting AWS CLI errors](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md)\.

------
#### [ Command line \- Current user ]

1. To specify which folder the AWS CLI is installed to, you must create an XML file with any file name\. This file is an XML\-formatted file that looks like the following example\. Leave all values as shown, except you must replace the path */Users/myusername* in line 9 with the path to the folder you want the AWS CLI installed to\. *The folder must already exist, or the command fails\.* The following XML example, named *choices\.xml*, specifies the installer to install the AWS CLI in the folder `/Users/myusername`, where it creates a folder named `aws-cli`\.

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <array>
       <dict>
         <key>choiceAttribute</key>
         <string>customLocation</string>
         <key>attributeSetting</key>
         <string>/Users/myusername</string>
         <key>choiceIdentifier</key>
         <string>default</string>
       </dict>
     </array>
   </plist>
   ```

1. Download the `pkg` installer using the `curl` command\. The `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to\. In this example, the file is written to `AWSCLIV2.pkg` in the current folder\.

   ```
   $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
   ```

1. Run the standard macOS `installer` program with the following options:
   + Specify the name of the package to install by using the `-pkg` parameter\.
   + Specify installing to a *current user only* by setting the `-target` parameter to `CurrentUserHomeDirectory`\.
   + Specify the path \(relative to the current folder\) and name of the XML file that you created in the `-applyChoiceChangesXML` parameter\.

   The following example installs the AWS CLI in the folder `/Users/myusername/aws-cli`\.

   ```
   $ installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg \
               -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory \
               -applyChoiceChangesXML choices.xml
   ```

1. Because standard user permissions typically don't allow writing to folders in your `$PATH`, the installer in this mode doesn't try to add the symlinks to the `aws` and `aws_completer` programs\. For the AWS CLI to run correctly, you must manually create the symlinks after the installer finishes\. If your `$PATH` includes a folder you can write to and you specify the folder as the target's path, you can run the following command without `sudo`\. If you don't have a writable folder in your `$PATH`, you must use `sudo` for permissions to write to the specified target folder\. The default location for a symlink is `/usr/local/bin/`\.

   ```
   $ sudo ln -s /folder/installed/aws-cli/aws /usr/local/bin/aws
   $ sudo ln -s /folder/installed/aws-cli/aws_completer /usr/local/bin/aws_completer
   ```

   After installation is complete, debug logs are written to `/var/log/install.log`\.

1. To verify that the shell can find and run the `aws` command in your `$PATH`, use the following commands\. 

   ```
   $ which aws
   /usr/local/bin/aws 
   $ aws --version
   aws-cli/2.7.24 Python/3.8.8 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.4.5
   ```

   If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting AWS CLI errors](cli-chap-troubleshooting.md)\.
