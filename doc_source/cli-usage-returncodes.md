# Understanding return codes from the AWS CLI<a name="cli-usage-returncodes"></a>

To determine the return code of an AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) command, run one of the following commands immediately after running the CLI command\.

**Linux/Unix/Mac systems**

```
$ echo $?
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```
PS> echo $lastexitcode
```

**Windows Command Prompt**

```
C:\> echo %errorlevel%
```

The following are the return code values that can be returned at the end of running an AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) command\.


****  

| Code | Meaning | 
| --- | --- | 
| 0 | The command completed successfully\. There were no errors generated by either the AWS CLI or by the AWS service to which the request was sent\. | 
| 1 | One or more Amazon S3 transfer operations failed\. Limited to S3 commands\. | 
| 2 |  The meaning of this return code depends on the command:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-returncodes.html)  | 
| 130 | The command was interrupted by a SIGINT \(Ctrl\+C\)\. | 
| 255 | The command failed\. There were errors generated by the AWS CLI or by the AWS service to which the request was sent\. | 

For more details about a failure, run the command with the `--debug` switch\. This produces a detailed report of the steps the AWS CLI uses to process the command, and what the result of each step was\.
