# Understanding return codes from the AWS CLI<a name="cli-usage-returncodes"></a>

The return code is usually a hidden code sent after running a AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) command which describes the status of the command\. You can use the `echo` command to display the code sent from the last AWS CLI command and use these codes to determine if a command was successful or if it failed, and why a command may have an error\. In addition to the return codes, you can view more details about a failure by running your commands with the `--debug` switch\. This switch produces a detailed report of the steps the AWS CLI uses to process the command, and what the result of each step was\.

To determine the return code of an AWS CLI command, run one of the following commands immediately after running the CLI command\. 

------
#### [ Linux and macOS ]

```
$ echo $?
0
```

------
#### [ Windows PowerShell ]

```
PS> echo $lastexitcode
0
```

------
#### [ Windows Command Prompt ]

```
C:\> echo %errorlevel%
0
```

------

The following are the return code values that can be returned at the end of running an AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) command\.


| Code | Meaning | 
| --- | --- | 
| 0 |  The command completed successfully\. There were no errors generated by the AWS CLI and AWS service the request was sent to\.  | 
| 1 |  One or more Amazon S3 transfer operations failed\. *Limited to S3 commands\.*  | 
| 2 |  The meaning of this return code depends on the command:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-returncodes.html)  | 
| 130 |  The command was interrupted by a SIGINT\. This is the signal sent by you to cancel a command with `Ctrl`\+`C`\.  | 
| 252 |  Command syntax was invalid, an unknown parameter was provided, or a parameter value was incorrect and prevented the command from running\.  | 
| 253 |  The system environment or configuration was invalid\. While the command provided may be syntactically valid, missing configuration or credentials prevented the command from running\.  | 
| 254 |  The command successfully parsed and a request made to the specified service but the service returned an error\. This will generally indicate incorrect API usage or other service specific issues\.  | 
| 255 |  The command failed\. There were errors generated by the AWS CLI or by the AWS service to which the request was sent\.  |
