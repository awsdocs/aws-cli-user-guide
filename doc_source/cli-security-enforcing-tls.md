# Enforcing a minimum version of TLS 1\.2<a name="cli-security-enforcing-tls"></a>

To add increased security when communicating with AWS services, you should configure your AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) to use TLS 1\.2 or later\. When you use the AWS CLI, Python is used to set the TLS version\.

Based on your AWS CLI version, the steps you perform to enforce a TLS minimum of 1\.2 varies\.

## Configuring the AWS CLI version 1 to enforce a minimum version of TLS 1\.2 minimum<a name="enforcing-tls-v1"></a>

To ensure the AWS CLI version 1 uses no TLS version earlier than TLS 1\.2, you might need to recompile OpenSSL to enforce this minimum and then recompile Python to use the newly built OpenSSL\. 

### Determine your currently supported protocols<a name="enforcing-tls-supported"></a>

First, create a self\-signed certificate to use for the test server and the Python SDK using OpenSSL\.

```
$ openssl req -subj '/CN=localhost' -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

Then spin up a test server using OpenSSL\.

```
$ openssl s_server -key key.pem -cert cert.pem -www
```

In a new terminal window, create a virtual environment and install the Python SDK\.

```
$ python3 -m venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate
pip install botocore
```

Create a new Python script named `check.py` that uses the SDKâ€™s underlying HTTP library\.

```
$ import urllib3
URL = 'https://localhost:4433/'

http = urllib3.PoolManager(
    ca_certs='cert.pem',
    cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED',
)
r = http.request('GET', URL)
print(r.data.decode('utf-8'))
```

Run your new script\.

```
$ python check.py
```

This displays details about the connection made\. Search for "Protocol : " in the output\. If the output is "TLSv1\.2" or later, the SDK defaults to TLS v1\.2 or later\. If it's an earlier version, you need to recompile OpenSSL and recompile Python\.

However, even if your installation of Python defaults to TLS v1\.2 or later, it's still possible for Python to renegotiate to a version earlier than TLS v1\.2 if the server doesn't support TLS v1\.2 or later\. To check that Python doesn't automatically renegotiate to earlier versions, restart the test server with the following\.

```
$ openssl s_server -key key.pem -cert cert.pem -no_tls1_3 -no_tls1_2 -www
```

If you're using an earlier version of OpenSSL, you might not have the `-no_tls_3` flag available\. If this is the case, remove the flag because the version of OpenSSL you're using doesn't support TLS v1\.3\. Then rerun the Python script\.

```
$ python check.py
```

If your installation of Python correctly doesn't renegotiate for versions earlier than TLS 1\.2, you should receive an SSL error\.

```
$ urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=4433): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, '[SSL: UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL] unsupported protocol (_ssl.c:1108)')))
```

If you're able to make a connection, you need to recompile OpenSSL and Python to disable negotiation of protocols earlier than TLS v1\.2\.

### Compile OpenSSL and Python<a name="enforcing-tls-compile"></a>

To ensure the SDK or AWS CLI doesn't negotiate for anything earlier than TLS 1\.2, you need to recompile OpenSSL and Python\. To do this, copy the following content to create a script and run it\.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

OPENSSL_VERSION="1.1.1d"
OPENSSL_PREFIX="/opt/openssl-with-min-tls1_2"
PYTHON_VERSION="3.8.1"
PYTHON_PREFIX="/opt/python-with-min-tls1_2"


curl -O "https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-$OPENSSL_VERSION.tar.gz"
tar -xzf "openssl-$OPENSSL_VERSION.tar.gz"
cd openssl-$OPENSSL_VERSION
./config --prefix=$OPENSSL_PREFIX no-ssl3 no-tls1 no-tls1_1 no-shared
make > /dev/null
sudo make install_sw > /dev/null


cd /tmp
curl -O "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/$PYTHON_VERSION/Python-$PYTHON_VERSION.tgz"
tar -xzf "Python-$PYTHON_VERSION.tgz"
cd Python-$PYTHON_VERSION
./configure --prefix=$PYTHON_PREFIX --with-openssl=$OPENSSL_PREFIX --disable-shared > /dev/null
make > /dev/null
sudo make install > /dev/null
```

This compiles a version of Python that has a statically linked OpenSSL that doesn't automatically negotiate anything earlier than TLS 1\.2\. This also installs OpenSSL in the `/opt/openssl-with-min-tls1_2` directory and installs Python in the `/opt/python-with-min-tls1_2` directory\. After you run this script, confirm installation of the new version of Python\.

```
$ /opt/python-with-min-tls1_2/bin/python3 --version
```

This should print out the following\.

```
$ Python 3.8.1
```

To confirm this new version of Python doesn't negotiate a version earlier than TLS 1\.2, rerun the steps from [Determine your currently supported protocols](#enforcing-tls-supported) using the newly installed Python version \(that is, `/opt/python-with-min-tls1_2/bin/python3`\)\.

## Configuring the AWS CLI version 2 to enforce a minimum version of TLS 1\.2<a name="enforcing-tls-v2"></a>

AWS CLI version 2 uses an internal Python script that's compiled to use a minimum of TLS 1\.2 when the service it's talking to supports it\. No further steps are needed to enforce this minimum\.
